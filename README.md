# Prog2Cpp

These are the projects I created in COP3503, Intro to Programming 2, C++.

Projects Include:
- linkedlist
- calculator
- magic square
- a memory management program (PA2)
- expression evaluator (PA3)
- a game of snake (uses OpenGL) 

Note: The use of OpenGL makes it so the application can depend on the internals of the computer. 
This version ran on my 2013 Macbook Air, but the alternate MakeFile can enable it to run on a Linux machine.
